  <li>
    Fry the sausage slices until they brown on both sides - the fat will render
    out, and it's this we'll use to help fry the eggs.
  </li>

  <li>
    Break in the eggs - let them sizzle until just crisping around the edges.
  </li>

  <li>
    Pop a lid on it. Putting a lid on the pan helps the tops of the eggs cook
    without turning.
  </li>

  <li>
    Sprinkle over herbs. I like to add a little fresh note in the form of herbs
    - dill, parsley and mint all work well.
